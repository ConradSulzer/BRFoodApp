# BRFoodApp

BRFoodApp.com was an app I developed at the beginning of the COVID-19 shutdown. It served as a restaurant guide for the Baton Rouge area highlighting what local eateries were open and what services they were offering to the public. Since restaurants have since reopened I have retired the app, but still have it hosted on Heroku at https://brfoodapp.herokuapp.com/.
